## Video Tutorials for Capacity Building

This handbook entry compiles a curated set of video tutorials designed to support **capacity building within OET**. The videos cover both the core **PyPSA models (Eur and Earth)** and general **developer practices** that strengthen the skills needed to contribute effectively to open-source energy system modelling. Together, they provide a structured learning path: from conceptual introductions, through hands-on exercises, to broader software development skills.

### PyPSA-Eur Training Videos

These resources are meant to guide users through fundamentals and advanced concepts of **PyPSA-Eur** and its sector coupling extensions. It’s recommended to start with the DTU course series and use the hands-on tutorial as supplementary practice.
