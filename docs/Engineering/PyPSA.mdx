# PyPSA

PyPSA stands for “Python for Power System Analysis”. It is pronounced “pipes-ah”.
PyPSA is an open source toolbox for simulating and optimising modern power and energy systems that include features such as conventional generators with unit commitment, variable wind and solar generation, storage units, coupling to other energy sectors, and mixed alternating and direct current networks. PyPSA is designed to scale well with large networks and long time series.

## Functionality

PyPSA can calculate:

- static power flow (using both the full non-linear network equations and the linearised network equations)
- linear optimal power flow (least-cost optimisation of power plant and storage dispatch within network constraints, using the linear network equations, over several snapshots)
security-constrained linear optimal power flow
- total electricity/energy system least-cost investment optimisation (using linear network equations, over several snapshots and investment periods simultaneously for optimisation of generation and storage dispatch and investment in the capacities of generation, storage, transmission and other infrastructure)

It has models for:

- meshed multiply-connected AC and DC networks, with controllable converters between AC and DC networks
- standard types for lines and transformers following the implementation in pandapower
- conventional dispatchable generators and links with unit commitment
- generators with time-varying power availability, such as wind and solar generators
- storage units with efficiency losses
- simple hydroelectricity with inflow and spillage
- coupling with other energy carriers (e.g. resistive Power-to-Heat (P2H), Power-to-Gas (P2G), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), Fischer-Tropsch, direct air capture (DAC))
- basic components out of which more complicated assets can be built, such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units and heat pumps.
