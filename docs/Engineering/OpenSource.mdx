# Understanding Open Source Software Development

## What is Open Source?

**Open source** refers to something—often software—whose design is made publicly accessible, meaning anyone can view, modify, and share it. While the term originally emerged in the realm of software development, it has since evolved to embody a broader philosophy often called **"the open source way."** This philosophy champions values such as open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.

## What is open source software?

**Open source software (OSS)** is software whose source code is freely available for inspection, modification, and enhancement. Unlike proprietary software—where only the creator can modify the code—OSS empowers a community of developers to continually improve and evolve the software. These developers may:

- Add new features
- Fix bugs
- Improve performance
- Adapt the software to suit different needs

By making the source code accessible, open source software can foster innovation at a pace rarely matched by traditional, closed development models.

## Is open source always free?

There’s a common misconception that "open source" automatically means "free of charge." While many open source projects are indeed available without cost, the concept of "free" here more directly concerns *freedom*—the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute the code.

Open source licenses often encourage a model where developers and companies can:

- Charge for services such as installation, customization, and ongoing support.
- Earn revenue through consulting, training, and maintenance contracts.

In other words, open source projects can generate financial value in numerous ways, even if the software itself is distributed at no cost.

## The open source way

The **open source way** extends beyond software. It’s a set of principles and best practices derived from open source communities and applied to various industries, organizations, and collaborative endeavors. These principles, when integrated into different fields, can catalyze innovation, transparency, and collective problem-solving.

### Key principles of the open source way

**1. Transparency**  
Free access to information enables everyone involved to make more informed decisions, understand the impact of those decisions, and iterate on them collaboratively.

**2. Collaboration**  
With openness comes an invitation for participation. By allowing everyone to modify and improve upon shared work, we unlock a wealth of collective creativity and expertise.

**3. Release early and often**  
Frequent, iterative releases encourage rapid learning. By continually testing new ideas in real-world scenarios, projects evolve more quickly, and feedback loops shorten, leading to better outcomes.

**4. Inclusive meritocracy**  
Good ideas can emerge from anywhere. Open source communities value quality and innovation over personal agendas. Decisions are often guided by the merit of contributions rather than the status of the contributor.

**5. Community**  
Thriving communities form around shared interests and goals. They bring together diverse perspectives, unify efforts, and ensure that the project grows sustainably, guided by collectively established principles.

## Licensing open projects
	
:::warning

A common misconception exists that stating "use this however you like" provides sufficient legal framework for open projects.
This often creates more problems than it solves.
Always add an explicit license to your project, regardless of complexity.

:::

All open source and open data projects require a formal license.
A licence specifies the legal terms governing usage, modification, and distribution rights for third parties.
Without a formal license, a project cannot be considered *open*.
This is an essential document and serves two purposes:
Mitigating liability exposure and enabling legitimate utilisation by the broader community.

Choosing a license can be challenging and should be done at the start of a project after some consideration.
Consult your team for advice.
We usually use the following licensing framework for standard projects:

* **Software**: [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)
* **Generic configuration files for a repository**: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
* **Data**: [CC BY 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
* **Metadata**: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

Some projects require alternative licensing approaches after deliberation.
Further guidance on how we license projects can be found in [our copyright and attribution guidelines](./CopyrightAndAttribution.mdx).
