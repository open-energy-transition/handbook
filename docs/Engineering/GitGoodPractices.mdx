# Git good practices

To present a clean and organized git log, the following keywords can be added to the commit message. 
The keyword is usually indicative of the type of changes that have been made in that particular commit.

The proposed keywords are as follows:
1. "doc" - documentation related updates
2. "data" - if a data file is being added / removed
3. "config" - changes to the configuration files
4. "feature" - Feature update to the model
5. "code" - Updates to the code (For eg., a bug fix)
6. "notebook" - Updates to the jupyter notebooks

The commit message will be in the format \< keyword >:\< commit message >.
