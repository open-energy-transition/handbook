# Git good practices

## Branch names

To present a clean and organized repository, the following branch naming conventions should be followed  <type>_<description>. The <type> is usually indicative of the type of changes that will be made in the branch. The proposed types are:
- **feature** - new functionality being added to the codebase
- **bugfix** - fixing errors in existing functionality
- **refactor** - code improvements without changing functionality
- **docs** - documentation updates and improvements
- **test** - adding or modifying test cases


## Commit messages

To present a clean and organized git log, the following keywords can be added to the commit message. The keyword is usually indicative of the type of changes that have been made in that particular commit. Commit messages should follow the naming pattern <keyword>:<commit message>.  The proposed keywords are:
- **doc** - documentation related updates
- **data** - if a data file is being added / removed
- **config** - changes to the configuration files
- **feature** - feature update to the model
- **code** - updates to the code (For eg., a bug fix)
- **notebook** - updates to the jupyter notebooks
