# Git good practices

## Branch names

To present a clean and organized repository, the branch naming convention `<type>_<description>` shall be used. Both `<type>` and `<description>` are indicative of the kind of changes that will be made in the branch. The proposed types are:
- **feature** - new functionality being added to the codebase
- **bugfix** - fixing errors in existing functionality
- **refactor** - code improvements without changing functionality
- **docs** - documentation updates and improvements
- **test** - adding or modifying test cases


## Commit messages

To present a clean and organized `git log`, the commit message naming convention `<keyword>:<commit message>` shall be used. Both `<keyword>` and `<commit message>` are indicative of the kind of changes that are proposed in that particular commit. The proposed keywords are:
- **doc** - documentation related updates
- **data** - if a data file is being added / removed
- **config** - changes to the configuration files
- **feature** - feature update to the model
- **code** - updates to the code (for eg., a bug fix)
- **notebook** - updates to the jupyter notebooks
