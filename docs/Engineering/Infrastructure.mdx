# Information about infrastructure we want to preserve

We utilise different infrastructure for various purposes, below is some information that we want to preserve.
This is not meant to be a comprehensive list or for everyday use, rather a reference for rare use cases in the future.


## Discord bots

Discord bots can provide additional information and functionality to Discord servers and channels.
There's a variety of bots available, each with its own unique features and capabilities.
When choosing a bot, consider the specific needs as well as the Term's of Service of the bot.

### Connecting GitHub to a Discord channel

To receive information from GitHub on events, e.g. releases in a repository or new issues, a bot can be used.
Discord provides a simple bot that utilises webhooks to send messages to a channel.
Find instructions on how to set this up [here](https://gist.github.com/jagrosh/5b1761213e33fc5b54ec7f6379034a22)

We use this for our `#oet-handbook` channel to alert of major updates.
Events to which the bot should respond are configured in the GitHub repository settings under ["Webhooks"](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/handbook/settings/hooks/538394245).
Currently the `#oet-handbook` bot is configured to respond to the following events:
- Release
- Pull request

If one requires more functionality, there are other bots for connecting GitHub available, [this one for example](https://github.com/NicPWNs/GitHub-Discord-Bot).
