# A strong, healthy workplace culture at OET

A transferrable, well-founded, tangible, and consistent culture is paramount to enjoying the work that we do, our interactions, and maintaining a cohesive team all across the world!

At OET, we care a lot about our culture, know aboue the positive impacts it has on our team, and make sure we represent that culture at all levels, in all Departments and Teams, and throughout all our projects.

We want every member of our team to feel comfortable being themselves; comfortable owning and celebrating their wins; comfortable acknowledging and learning from their mistakes (we all make them); and comfortable communicating their aspirations, and personal values.

And remember, we're all human beings (except you, Snoopy). That means we may have very different ways of doing things, different ways of communicating, and different priorities. That's not only okay, it's great! It means we get to learn from one another. It's really about a balance of respecting one another, while also working with one another to, at least sometimes, meet in the middle so we can accomplish common goals. And that's totally doable!

Finally, at OET, our values remain consistent while our culture evolves. Culture isn't stagnant - it changes according to the times, according to the work we do, and according to who is on our team. There's no problem with that, so long as our values are always regarded.

# Comfort

Whether you're deep in a presentation, sitting in a coworking space with your favorite pantsuit on, or chilling on a recliner at home in your comfy space pyjamas, with your dog at your side, posting GIFs in Meme Land on Discord, we want you to know you're valued, recognized, celebrated for your uniqueness, and trusted to freely do what you do best. So long as you're contributing towards our mission and fulfilling the requirements of your role... you do you! There's no judgement here.

And, though there's absolutely no expectation to... if you do want to share a part of yourself with anyone at OET - your favorite video game, a book you recently enjoyed, your favorite thing to cook, or a pretty hiking trail you found over the weekend, go for it! There's a good chance you'll find someone who has similar interests on our team.

This is all to say that at OET, we have a culture of overlapping values, but different interests. A culture of acceptance.

# Values

Values (meaningful ones, at least), are a key part of strong, cohesive, and enjoyable cultures. It's important that we stick to our main values, and lead by example.

At OET, we have **6 main values** that guide everything we do.

Of course, as an NGO, and in accordance with our purpose, we are driven by a value of being consistently open-source. That is fundamental to our goals. But, we also have a few values relating to how we work together as a team. They form part of our internal culture.

With buy-in from our wonderful team of OETers, these values are incorporated into our long-term strategy, our day-to-day business decisions, the work that we do, and how we interact with one another as part of a team.

They really do serve as the foundation of why we are here and how we have an impact on society, as well as the goals and aspirations of those who contribute towards OET’s mission.

### Transparency

We strive to be as forthcoming with information as possible, with open, fluid communication channels, and clear feedback that travels in all directions. That is the only way we can ensure that we remain aligned, and that we all have the opportunity to learn and grow. Our team comprises many different skills, and sharing them is important. Through fostering a transparent culture, we build trust (another of our values).

### Collaboration

We are extremely autonomous and self-managed, however we do still collaborate extensively, across roles, Teams, Departments, and projects. That is intrinsic to the kind of work that we do. It is also how we ensure that our common goals are met, and ensure that knowledge sharing is consistent. A lot of our work is done asynchronously, but we also have a healthy amount of teamwork in support of our mission.

### Humility

We try our best to always remain modest. It is vital that none of us automatically assume we are the smartest person in the room. And, even if we know we are the best at something, to always remember that someone else might have a great idea we did not think of, and that their input is still valued. OET has no space for egos. We are all about open discussions, continuous growth, open-mindedness, mutual respect, and being humble about our achievements.

### Autonomy

We all have a very high level of autonomy at OET. That goes hand-in-hand with acknowledging that we hire skilled people, and then give them the freedom to do what they do best, ideally (insofar as is possible) in a way that they are comfortable with and can get behind. We all know how satisfying it is to be able to make and own decisions within your remit, and have managers there just to enable and guide. That is the standard approach we take within our structure at OET.

### Trust

We trust inherently. That means no one is expected to start from ground zero and earn all the trust they get. Rather, they get a high level of trust upfront, as soon as they start engaging with us (even before they have joined our team). This trust then translates into easily being able to give everyone the level of self-management we are so proud of.

### Recognition

We make a point of publicly and privately voicing our appreciation for each other’s contributions and successes - whether mutual or individual. Across our teams, our culture is about uplifting one another, celebrating our wins, and giving credit where it is due (even for traditionally “small things”). And, importantly, because we are all ultimately working towards the same mission, when we succeed individually, we succeed as a team.
