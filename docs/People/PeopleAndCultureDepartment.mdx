# The People & Culture Department

## What we do

People Operations is a complete overhaul of traditional "HR", and is vastly different. In the People & Culture Department, we follow a People Ops approach to inform everything that we do.

As compared to traditional HR, which is typically very focused on hiring and policy enforcement, is quite siloed, and is traditionally more reactive, People Ops is involved across all business segments, is much more proactive, and manages, among other things:

- Building culture-based, flexible, informed policies and processes that serve to enhance how we operate (and improve our culture)
- Crafting and maintaining an attractive, enjoyable, respectful, and growth-oriented culture for all to enjoy
- Managing interpersonal matters, and ultimately working to ensure that everyone collaborates well together, towards our shared goals
- Hiring candidates who fit our goals well, and who will be fulfilled in their respective roles
- Full-scope onboarding, with the goal of ensuring that those who join Team OET are equipped to thrive
- Learning & Development
- Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
- Performance (and improvements)
- Strategic planning from a People perspective
- Any other People-related matters
