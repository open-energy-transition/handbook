# Onboarding

Onboarding is incredibly important for us at OET. We highly recommend taking at least a couple of days for onboarding followed by team specific onboarding and training. 
Please feel free to participate in your team’s work in your first week, but don’t feel like you have to contribute heavily. 
The following guide will give you some helpful information to get you started. 

For a smooth as possible onboarding we have created a new `Onboarding Project` for you on the [OET GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/open-energy-transition/projects).
For your first days, on the so-called `Kanban Board` in this project you can find a list of ToDo's that are assigned to you and which you can complete one by one.

We are thrilled to have you on board, welcome to the OET team!

## Get started on day 1

On your first day, you will be welcomed by your manager in a short onboarding meeting where they will explain to you some first steps.

You should also have been added to OET's Discord server, which is the centre of our daily communication. 
On your first day when you join Discord, introduce yourself briefly in the `#welcome` channel.
For more information on how we use Discord and how to get the most out of it, see the [Discord](docs/Company/RemoteWorking.mdx#discord) section of our Remote Working page.

You can then start working on your `Kanban Board` in your custom `Onboarding Project` on the [OET GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/open-energy-transition/projects).
Once you have completed a task, you can mark it as done. If some tasks are not relevant for your role, you can also mark them as done.
Ask your manager to find the right person to support you with tasks that must be done for you (e.g. set up an OET email for you).

## First week

During your first week you will continue to work through the issues of your `Onboarding Project` until they are all completed and the project can be closed.
In your first week, you will be officially introduced to the team in person in the [E-Group Weekly](docs/Company/EGroupWeekly.mdx), which takes place online every Tuesday at 2 p.m. CET.
This is also your chance to meet everyone in person and say a few words.

It is very important to us that you always feel supported with any questions that you may have during the onboarding process and afterwards. 
In order to have someone to talk to and share questions and concerns with, you will be assigned a buddy who you will meet during your first week. 
The general idea is that your buddy will also be involved in the work that you will be doing afterwards, so that you can discuss specific technical issues.

Within the first few days you will also be contacted by your manager who will slowly introduce you to the projects you will be working on. 
You will be given some initial tasks and reading material to get you started and familiarise you with the projects.

## Checklist

By the end of your first week, please ensure that you:
- [ ] Have an `@openenergytransition.org` email address and have joined the OET Discord server
- [ ] Have a GitHub account and are on the OET GitHub [people page](https://github.com/orgs/open-energy-transition/people) (ask Siddharth Krishna if you need support with this)
- [ ] Are on the OET website's [team page](https://openenergytransition.org/about-us.html#team): instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/oet-data-bank) (ask Akshat Mittal if you need support with this)
- [ ] Have gone through this Onboarding page, and added to it any information that you found was missing in your first week (see [Editing the handbook](docs/Handbook/EditingTheHandbook.mdx))
- [ ] Have the weekly Tuesday all-OET meeting in your calendar (ask Victor Martinez if you don't)
- [ ] Have a buddy and have had a call with them; also feel free to hang out in the `co-working` or `coffee-room` Discord channels to get to know the rest of the OET team!

## Managers

Managers of new OET members, please ensure that a new `Onboarding Project` is created on the `open-energy-transition` GitHub for the new team member at least 4 business days prior to their start date. 
You can copy the `Example Draft` project and expand it with relevant tasks.
The example project's `Kanban Board` also contains issues that are to be completed by the responsible manager, IT team, and HR team, in addition to the new member during the onboarding process.
Managers, HR and IT Ops all have tasks that need to be completed prior to the start date to ensure a smooth and successful onboarding process. 

For questions or help with any of these tasks feel free to reach out to the responsible HR lead.

## Non-tech staff

Non-tech staff such as those in HR, design, marketing, etc. are also encouraged to set-up a GitHub-account and be added to the OET GitHub organization.
