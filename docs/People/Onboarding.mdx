# Onboarding

OET would like to welcome you, once again, to our team. We're very happy to have you!

Please read through the below info, as it will guide you through your onboarding (for day 1, week 1, and month 1).

## Day 1

On your first day, your manager will arrange a meeting with you to explain their managerial approach, chat about what you'll be working on, and answer any questions you may have.

### Please ensure that by the end of day 1:

1. Your email signature is formatted correctly (you can use Quintin's as a template) 
2. Your Discord name makes sense to other OETers
3. You type a message in our #welcome channel in Discord, so others can say hi to you (feel free to use someone else's message as a foundation).

## Week 1

During your first week, please go through the Handbook, and familiarize yourself with any relevant projects you'll be working on. It's recommended to use this time to get to know your team (and the broader OET team), and to set up your devices and platforms.

There is no need to feel like you have to know everything there is to know about your role, your responsibilities, your projects, or OET. You're new here, and we understand and respect that. Take it easy, and enjoy settling into your new position. There will be time in future for questions and learning.

Quintin, our Head of People, will reach out to you during your first week, for an introductory call.

You may also get invitations from keen OETers who wish to get to know you better. If you're busy, please know you can move them to more suitable times. Use your judgement, as always.

Please make sure that your OET Google Workspace account, Discord, Remote (if applicable), ATS (if applicable), Navan, password manager, Cal.com, and GitHub (OET project) are set up by the end of your first week. If you still require access to any of these, kindly reach out to Quintin (quintin.coetzee@openenergytransition.org).

### Please ensure that by the end of week 1:

1. You have access to all necessary platforms (listed above)
2. You have completed all empty info fields on Remote (if you have been added to this platform)
3. You have met with your manager, with Quintin, and with a few members of your team
4. You are clear on what is expected of you for the rest of your first month (if not, please ask your manager)
5. You have added yourself to our website's "Team" section via our data bank (https://github.com/open-energy-transition/oet-data-bank)
6. Someone has added you to our weekly all-hands meeting that takes place each Tuesday (if not, please ask Quintin to do so)

## Month 1

By now, your onboarding should be complete. Please check in with your manager at the end of your first month, to ensure you're on track with any expectations they may have, and to sync up on any feedback you may wish to share with them.

### Please ensure that by the end of month 1:

1. You have read through all relevant parts of the Handbook
2. Your are familiar with your team, in terms of who you're working with, and their default communication style/s
3. You have had an opportunity to ask your manager any questions you may have

## For managers

For all managers of new OETers, please ensure that you set aside ample time to converse, take questions, provide feedback, and get to know one another. This is a vital part of successful onboarding.

Please also set clear expectations for any outcomes you have for the first month, and then revisit these at the end of the first month.

Finally, kindly facilitate syncs with our new OETer's teammates, by setting up some calendar events for them. Not everyone is confident enough to dip into someone else's calendar immediately, so any assistance you can provide in this regard is appreciated.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to Quintin.

## Further reading

Remember, our Handbook is constantly evolving. Some parts are complete, and others are templates. If any info you need is missing, just ask the page maintainer, or Quintin. If you'd like to contribute something, you are welcome to. Just make sure you assign the relevant person/s to review the edit. Thank you!
