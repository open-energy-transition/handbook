# Offboarding

<ControlledDocBanner />

Offboarding is managed by our People Team, in collaboration with the person leaving OET, as well as their manager.

We request that anyone leaving OET supports an effective offboarding process, be that with enabling a proper handover of active projects and relevant files, or through the training of someone new stepping into their role, if that is the case.

It is the responsibility of the person's manager to coordinate with any relevant Project Leads as part of offboarding. If a lead maintainer is leaving OET, their manager should ensure that all tools are properly transferred to a new OETer.

The manager of the person leaving OET must ensure that by the end of their last day:
- All relevant handover tasks have been completed, including the sharing of relevant cloud storage and login credentials
- Any requests for an exit interview have been conveyed to the Head of People
- Any special requests for the person's email account (such as auto responses) have been sent to our Head of People
- Any special requests for the transfer of cloud storage to the manager have been sent to our Head of People
- A pull request has been created to remove the person's photo and info from the [OET Data Bank](https://github.com/orgs/open-energy-transition/people)
- The person's solver license keys are deactivated (ask Sid Krishna if you need support with this)

Our People Team will:
- Remove access to platforms only once the final workday has ended
- Supply the person with a Statement of Service on request
- Complete and issue any relevant government documents
- Process Remote admin, if applicable
- Commence with relevant internal admin for offboarding
- Coordinate amongst teams to ensure a smooth offboarding process for all OETers
