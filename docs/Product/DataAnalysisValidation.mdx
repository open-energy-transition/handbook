# Data analysis and validation
<ControlledDocBanner />

## Data analysis

Data analysis, performed by us, revolves around the data gathering, required for modeling the power systems from different perspectives:

- it is both the technical and the economic data, used as the backbone for the unit commitment/economic dispatch, the power flow simulation, as well as the power system expansion,
- data analysis has a crucial role, prior the power system's simulation, as the correct input data is the foundation of the work that follows.

## Data validation

The way to go around inspecting the validity of the input data is by examining the historically recorded results, against the model's output results. It is a well known [backcasting](https://www.semcommittee.com/publications/sem-21-086-sem-plexos-model-validation-2021-2029-and-backcast-report) process, the standard used across the industry.

_It operates on the principle of the feedback loop, where the input data is tuned, until the output matches the recorded historical values, to the best of ability, rendering the input data valid._

`Backcast` complements the `forecast`, considering the focus of the former is placed on identifying the correct input, to be used for the further calculation, i.e. the forecast.

_That said, a successful backcast precedes every forecast, providing validity to the entire process._
