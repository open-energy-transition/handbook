# About the OET product

<ControlledDocBanner />

Open Energy Transition (OET) continues to build on open source software. PyPSA project, initially started in Academia, back in 2015, is being developed actively.

As of now, the PyPSA engine counts approx. 25,000 lines of Python code.

## Product development

Open Energy Transition actively uses, and extends PyPSA, for the purposes of studies, consultations, workshops, presentations, conferences and projects.

- PyPSA modules are further improved, as required by the the aforementioned projects/studies and the consultation services, being conducted in different geographical areas.
- Any such modifications are backfed upstream, to the original PyPSA-X repository.

The code gets reviewed and modified by dozens of associates/contributors in power systems planning, operation and energy economics.

The publicly available OET and PyPSA code is free for use, as well as further modifications. The modifications can be submitted to the GitHub upstream repositories, using GitHub Fork -> Pull Request. Upon the review, the code maintainer acts on the basis of proposed code change:
- accepts the change,
- comments on the change,
- rejects the change, providing a reason.
