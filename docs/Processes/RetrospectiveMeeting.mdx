## 1. Process Guidelines

### General process:
To facilitate internal knowledge sharing, OET aims to establish a standardized retrospective process within project teams after project closure. Your project retrospective should ideally follow these guidelines:

1. Share [the template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uq9vFDLqzjs5wcra-26k10tyrjaDSaR8-R4K3ITTe5Q) with your team members in advance and set up a meeting. We recommend taking ~90 minutes.

2. Start the meeting with the agenda.

3. Assign roles, incl. Moderator (does not need to be the PM), Timekeeper and Note-taker.

4. Adapt as needed - this process is flexible and needs to fit your context.

5. Share the completed template with the broader OET team.

6. Present your project summary slide and lessons learned during the next formal all-hands meeting.

7. Send the satisfaction questionnaire to the client


### Material

A slide deck template is available on the company's [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uq9vFDLqzjs5wcra-26k10tyrjaDSaR8-R4K3ITTe5Q).

## 2. Overview of the meeting

### Topics
The meeting aims to cover the following topics:

1. **Project objectives & outcomes**: Revisit the project’s original objectives and assess how each was met.
2. **What Went Well & Even Better If**:
   * Identify the strategies, methodologies, or tools that were particularly effective.
   * Highlight positive client feedback and discuss what resonated well with them.
3. **Processes & Dynamics**: Review how the team coordinated and managed tasks.
4. **Resources Management**:
   * Review how resources, budgets, and timelines were managed.
   * Summarize number of runs, model complexity (resolution), resources (CPUh, computational cost)
5. **Knowledge Sharing**:
   * Capture key insights and lessons for organizational learning.
   * Discuss how to share these best practices across teams to foster continuous improvement.

6. **Future Opportunities**: Identify opportunities for follow-up projects or additional services for the client.

### Outcome

This process uses the collective intelligence of the team to produce two key slides:
* **Project overview**: A summary of the project, including links to the results. This slide is an important asset for building a record of the past projects.
* **Lessons learned & Best practices**: A summary of the learnings and best practices used or discovered thanks to the project.

⭐ Don’t forget to celebrate! Take time to celebrate the project’s achievements and the hard work of the team.
