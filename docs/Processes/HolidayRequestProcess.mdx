## 1. Leave request process for all OET staff

### General process:
All leave requests are managed through Remote.com, ensuring a streamlined, single-platform tracking system for employees and contractors across the globe. To book leave, follow these steps:

1. Make sure to check the requirements and considerations applicable to each type of leave (in the following section).
2. Sign into your Remote.com account.
3. Go to **“Time Off”** on the left.
4. Select the desired dates by clicking or dragging.
5. Select the applicable option (e.g., “Sick” or “Paid Time Off”).
6. Some requirements and considerations may apply depending on the type and length of the leave.
7. Add any applicable notes (including if you have checked with your Project Manager(s) and/or a member of the Core team).
8. If your sick leave requires a doctor’s note (check list below), please attach the document to your request.
9. Click **“Request Time Off.”**

Your request will then be processed by someone from the Core team.


## 2. Requirements and considerations for main types of leave:

- **Planned paid leave (e.g., vacations and PTO):**
  - Check with your Project Managers and/or OET’s core team to ensure that your leave can be accommodated without risking the timely delivery of projects, deliverables, or significant disruption to operations.  

- **Extended leave (above two weeks):**
  - Consult as early as possible to increase the chances that your request can be accommodated without issues.

- **Sick leave and unforeseen circumstances:**
  - Notify your PMs and/or OET’s core team as early as possible, providing an estimation of when you will return to work.  
  - Submit a leave request through Remote.com when possible, and include a medical certificate if required (for extended sick leave).

- **Other types of leave (e.g., bereavement, parental):**
  - Refer to your local labor laws, as these vary by country.  
  - Discuss requests with PMs or the OET core team in advance.  
  - Special arrangements may be made where local labor laws do not cover these requests, subject to approval by a member of the Core team.


## 3. Contractor leave

- **Process:**  
  - Contractors must indicate any days they will be unavailable (for any reason, including sickness or observing bank holidays) through the process listed in Section 1.  

- **Notification:**  
  - Provide as much notice as possible to maintain continuity and prevent project disruptions.

- **Important note:**
  - This does not constitute Paid Time Off (PTO), as contracts specify either the project scope or the exact number of contracted working days.  
  - This is only a notification for coordination and record-keeping, not an employment benefit.


## 4. Requirements for booking sick leave

- **General requirement:**
  - Please make sure to check your country’s laws to confirm specific requirements (e.g., through web search or the Employee Handbook on Remote). Generally, for any sick leave of three days or more, employees must provide a medical certificate.

### Country-specific medical certificate requirements:
- **Chile:** Required after three consecutive sick days.  
- **Colombia:** Required after two consecutive days.  
- **Croatia:** Required after three consecutive sick days.  
- **France:** Generally required from the first day, though company policies may adjust this.  
- **Germany:** Required after the third consecutive day.  
- **India:** Varies by state but generally required for three days or longer.  
- **Italy:** Required after the first day.  
- **Kazakhstan:** Typically required for three days or longer.

- **Panama:** Typically required after the third day.  
- **United Kingdom (UK):** Generally required after seven consecutive days of absence.


## 5. Special leave

- **Other types of leave (e.g., unpaid leave, parental leave):**
  - Availability, duration, and processes vary by country due to local labor laws.  

- **Family leave:**
  - Maternity and paternity leave entitlements vary by country, with differences in duration and paid/unpaid status.  

- **Bereavement leave:**
  - May be available in certain countries and typically covers a short period for immediate family members.  

- **Unpaid leave:**
  - Options may be available for special circumstances, subject to country regulations and OET's internal policies.  

### Process:
- Submit requests for special leave on Remote.com following the same initial procedure as for sick or vacation leave.  
- Specific documentation or advance notice may be needed, depending on the country.

### Compliance:
- All leave policies, including family, bereavement, and unpaid leave, align with local labor laws to ensure compliance with country-specific requirements for employee entitlements, notification periods, and documentation.
