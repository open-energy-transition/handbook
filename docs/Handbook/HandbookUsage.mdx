# Handbook Usage

## Handbook-first approach

The Open Energy Transition handbook is where the company information and processes are made easily accessible.

It is also a tool used to facilitate process modifications, by means of an _handbook-first_ approach.

In fact, instead of proposing changes via an email, chat message or any another medium, we follow what described below:
- A (process) problem comes up, frequently in a chat, or similar.
- A proposal is made in a pull request to the handbook.
- The proposal is reviewed and discussed internally. If approved, it becomes a part of the handbook.

We recognize that this approach might be slower at first, but we believe that it saves time in the long run and avoids misunderstandings. This is because it allows the audience to understand better the context in which the change is proposed and what the implications for other potentially affected processes might be.

## How to use the handbook every day

- **Answering questions**: most guidelines in this handbook are meant to help and to be shared with others. If a question arises and its answer is provided in the handbook, do share the relative handbook link.
- **Publish discussion outcomes**: if you need to ask a team member for help, please realize that there is a good chance the majority of the community also does not know the answer. Be sure to document the answer to radiate this information to the whole community. After the question is answered, discuss where it should be documented in the handbook and who will do it.
- **Use the handbook to discuss a process change**: to propose a change to a process, make a pull request to the handbook. Using another channel to propose a handbook change (email, chats etc.) is discouraged, as discussed in **Handbook-first approach**.
- **Base evergreen content on the handbook**: evergreen content like a leadership training should be based on the handbook. This is an important element of working handbook-first. Moreover, when creating a presentation for evergreen content, please screenshot the handbook and provide links to displayed pages rather than copy and pasting content. This is useful, as it saves you the effort of updating both the handbook and creating the content for the presentation.
