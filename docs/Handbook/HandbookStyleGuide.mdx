# Handbook Style Guide

<ControlledDocBanner />

## Introduction

The page details the styling guide to follow when contributing to the Handbook. In case of any further question, please reach out to the Maintainers of the page.

## Headings

Content headings should be second-level headings whereas first-level headings are reserved for page titles.
Moreover, content headings should summarise in the best way possible the corresponding paragraph. As an example

```
#   Page Title

##  Paragraph Content
```

## Capitalization

For titles and heading, the recommendation is to use [sentence case](https://www.thoughtco.com/sentence-case-titles-1691944). This means using capital letters in a sentence or capitalizing only the first word or any proper nouns.

## Links

Links to other handbook pages or to external resources should conform to the few general guidelines:

- linked text should describe the content the link leads to. A good choice would be to use the page title.
- use paths from the repository root for links to other handbook pages. For example, to link the handbook page [About the Handbook](docs/Handbook/AboutTheHandbook.mdx), use the path `docs/Handbook/AboutTheHandbook.mdx`.
- use absolute urls for links to external pages. For example to link the google website, use `https://www.google.com/`.
