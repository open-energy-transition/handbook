# About the Handbook

<ControlledDocBanner />

## Why a handbook
The Open Energy Transition handbook is the initiative to make our company information, mindset and processes easily accessible to all collaborators (present and future), and to whoever is interested in our activities.

## Advantages

At Open Energy Transition we take our handbook seriously, as it is a vital part of who we are and how we communicate. Among many, we see the following benefits:
- Teamwork becomes easier if you know how other parts of the company work.
- Discussions are faster if you can read what the current process looks like.
- Proposing process improvements becomes easier if you can just point to what you see differently.
- Attracting new talents is easier if people can see what are our values and how we operate.
- On-boarding is leaner, as new joiners can find all the relevant information spelled out.
- Everyone can contribute to it by proposing a change via a pull request.

## Handbook Interpretation

Open Energy Transition is a global company where different cultures and points of view meet. We do our best to be as clear as possible to minimize confusion.
If you have any question, we encourage you to reach out to the Maintainers of the page.
