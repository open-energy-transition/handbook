## Corporate design

TODOs

### Presentation template

TODO add link to presentation template and how to add it to your google slides

### Report template

### Email signature

Please setup and use the following email signature in your email client:

```
[Your Name]
[Your Position] â€“ A Non-Profit Tackling Energy Planning Challenges Worldwide

Schedule a meeting | LinkedIn | More on OET 

[OET Logo]
```

And make the adjustments:
* Add your name
* Add your position
* Add a link to your calendar for scheduling a meeting
* Add a link to your LinkedIn profile

It can be easier to just copy the signature from a colleague and adjust it to your needs.

### Wording and writing styles

To project a consistent and professional image, we try to adhere to the following guidelines
for wording and how to write about our work.

> Note: That these are guidelines and not strict rules.
> There are sometimes good reasons to deviate from them, e.g. when communicating with a client that uses a different style guide.

* "open source" and "open-source".
    * We use "open-source" when it serves as an adjective, e.g. "open-source software" or "we are an organisation specialising in open-source models for energy planning".
    * We use "open source" when it serves as a noun, e.g. "we contribute to the open source community".
