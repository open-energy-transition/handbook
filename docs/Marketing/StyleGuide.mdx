# OET's style guide
<ControlledDocBanner />

## Overview
A visual style guide is integrated into the branding strategy. Brand strategy serves as the bridge between business strategy and marketing strategy. It enables us to align marketing efforts with business objectives while clarifying who we are as a company, which clients we want to reach, and how to reach them. Internal alignment on brand strategy ensures consistent and cohesive communication with existing and potential clients. The brand strategy should encompass OET's value proposition, differentiation, strategic offerings, and positioning.
This page will show you the best use of the typography, colors, logo, and use of images, as well as the branding strategy with differentiation and tone of voice. Values, business strategy, and marketing strategy will not be directly touched upon in this section.

## Objective Style Guide
To align on style and ensure visual coherency across media. This influences how we build relationships with existing and potential clients and ensure their perception of OET aligns with our practices, competencies, and values.

When used on social media, a single photo should be square and contain the logo in white/transparency at 30% in the bottom right corner. When using several photos, they don't need to have a logo and can be in their original size.

## Differentiation
Differentiation means standing out from the competition in a meaningful way. It involves enhancing OET's uniqueness in clients' perception to create value for them. Currently, OET is perceived as young, innovative, and competent. Our value stems from unique expertise in PyPSA and open-source modeling in general.

## Strategic Offering
Open-source modeling, consultancy, and training for the energy sector and philanthropic foundations working toward decarbonization and accelerated energy transition.

## Tone of Voice
Brand personality influences clients' perception and the relationship between client and brand, for example, conveying reliability, intelligence, innovation, and contemporary relevance. For some clients, our voice needs to reassure them that they are in safe hands with a competent organization. For others, we need to stress the innovation potential and decarbonization vision. In essence, our voice is trustworthy, competent, and innovative. We want to have the following brand personality based on core values, voice, and distinct traits: Competence (Main) and Excitement (Support), source: Jennifer Aaker’s theory (1997).
