If you want support and assistance with your professional branding as a team member at OET, you are welcome to reach out to marketing and/or your project lead. The following are guidelines for if you want to join.
Clearly state that you are part of the organization. On LinkedIn, this can be done by ensuring that the affiliation with OET is clear in your profile headline. For instance, with a title such as "Software wizard at Open Energy Transition". This is to create transparency, since hidden advertisement is forbidden in Europe.

Suggestions to what team members can post on social media, which gives value to personal branding:
- Expert knowledge
- Inspiration
- Experience from conferences etc.

Guidelines:
- Be professional and respectful.
- Be precise and check your facts.
- Be engaging and talk WITH the audience, not at it. 
- Be ready to show personality (instead of only striving for perfection).
- Be clear and keep it to one point per piece of content.
- Be certain on copyright by using own pictures or pictures from copyright-free websites - and remember to give credits when necessary.
- Be brave with the use of hashtags, but maximum 4-5 per LinkedIn post.
- Include a good hook, a call to action, and relevant links to the project or related material.
