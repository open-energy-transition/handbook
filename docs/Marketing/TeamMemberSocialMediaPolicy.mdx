# Team Member Social Media Policy

<ControlledDocBanner />

Open Energy Transition is present on several social media platforms. We recommend following us to stay updated, join the conversation, and share news or thought leadership.
You can currently find us on:
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-energy-transition)
[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@OpenEnergyTransition)
[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/oetenergy.bsky.social)
[X](https://x.com/OETenergy)

As an organization, OET uses these channels to ensure that communication supports its brand and narrative by deliberately investing time and resources in social media and other forms of communication. This helps create a direct relationship with partners, funders, potential new employees, and various types of followers.
You can support this work through your behavior on social media.

<strong>REMEMBER</strong>: Participation on social media and sharing news about OET is completely voluntary.

If you wish to engage on social media as part of OET, clearly state that you are part of the organization BUT highlight that you are speaking on your own behalf (“opinions are my own”) and that you are not representing the entire organization. On LinkedIn, this can be done by ensuring your affiliation with OET is clear in your profile headline, for example: “Software Wizard at Open Energy Transition.”
This helps ensure transparency, as hidden advertising is prohibited in Europe.

Please see the [External Communication and Social Media Policy](../docs/Policies/ExternalCommunicationPolicy/), which outlines tone of voice, company values, and legal requirements when engaging in external communication. This includes showing respect for partners and being open, respectful, and professional.

## Employee Advocacy

Suggestions to what team members can post on social media, which give value to personal branding:
- Expert knowledge
- Inspiration
- Experiences from conferences

Guidelines:
- Be professional and respectful.
- Be accurate and fact-check your content.
- Be engaging and approachable—talk with your audience, not at them.
- Show personality.
- Be clear and focus on one main point per post.
- Respect copyright: use your own images or copyright-free resources, and remember to give credit when required.
- Use hashtags wisely and limit them to a maximum of 4–5 per LinkedIn post.
- Include a good hook, a call to action, and relevant links to your project or related material.

Feel free to reach out to Communication & Marketing if you want to hear more about Employee Advocacy and wish to positively brand yourself as a part of OET.
