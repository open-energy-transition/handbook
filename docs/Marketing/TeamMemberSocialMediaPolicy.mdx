# Team Member Social Media Policy

<ControlledDocBanner />

Team members are an important part of branding Open Energy Transition (OET), but mostly you as a team member should use it to brand yourself. 

Unlike marketing (what OET say about themselves), branding is what people think and say about OET. Team members can play a role in this.

<strong>REMEMBER</strong>: It is voluntary whether you want to post anything related to OET on your social media profile. If OET sets up a program for supporting and assisting personal and company branding, this is also voluntary to participate in. You decide. The following is guidelines for if you want to join.

Firstly, it is important that you clearly state that you are a part of the organization. On LinkedIn this can be done by ensuring that the affiliation with OET is clear in your profile headline. For instance with a title such as “Software wizard at Open Energy Transition”. This is to create transparency and since hidden advertisement is forbidden in Europe.

Suggestions to what team members can post on social media, which gives value to personal branding:
- Expert knowledge
- Inspiration
- Experience from conferences etc.

Guidelines:
- Be professional and respectful.
- Be precise and check your facts.
- Be engaging and talk WITH the audience, not to it. Include a call to action if you can.
- Be ready to show personality instead of striving for perfection.
- Be clear and keep it to one point per piece of centent.
- Be certain on copyright by using own pictures or pictures from copyright-free websites - and remember to give credits when necessary.
- Be brave with the use of hashtags, but maximum 4-5 per LinkedIn post.
