# Brand and Product Marketing
<ControlledDocBanner />

The marketing and communication teamâ€™s goal is to communicate the benefits of our service and product to the right people at the right time in order to keep and gain partners, advisors, and customers.

Marketing and branding supplement each other in the sense that marketing describes the efforts for sale made by the company while branding is what the customers think, feel, and say about the same company.

The team tells the story about the brand and products, and is in charge of the Employee Advocacy program and support thought leadership for brand ambassadors.
We also provide analyses on marketing efforts. 


<strong>Branding:</strong> We create awareness and trust for the OET brand.

<strong>Marketing:</strong> We develop insights and messages that communicate PyPSA and the OET projects.

<strong>Content:</strong> We create, review and improve content to make OET a flagship in the industry and academia.
