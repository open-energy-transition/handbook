# Payroll

OET payroll is processed near the end of each month (around the 25th). However, this may vary depending on whether your payroll goes through Remote, OET's direct German entity, or Contractor invoices.

If you do not receive your salary or invoice payment, and payslip, as expected, please reach out to our Finance Manager, Andris Prindulis (andris.prindulis@openenergytransition.org), and CC our Head of People, Quintin Coetzee (quintin.coetzee@openenergytransition.org). They will attend to this for you.

## Payslips

If you are an Employee, you will receive a payslip, with source deductions (like taxes) denoted. We recommend that you keep these on your personal storage, for tax filing purposes. If you are missing any payslips, please reach out to the OETers above.

Please whitelist the following email addresses.

- Remote payslips: no-reply@remote.com and help@remote.com
- German entity payslips: r.gsell@stiefler-rosenschon.de and @stiefler-rosenschon.de in general
- Contractor notifications: invoices@openenergytransition.org and andris.prindulis@openenergytransition.org

## What if I have a question about payroll?

Please feel free to reach out to the OETers above. In their absence, you can contact Cristina Ghimbas (cristina.ghimbas@openenergytransition.org).

You are also welcome to contact Remote directly, if your payroll is processed via that platform. You can email help@remote.com, and they will direct your query accordingly. It is best to reach out to them if you have a local tax-related query, as they have a team dedicated to processing such enquiries.
