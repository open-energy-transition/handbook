# Business Development Process
<ControlledDocBanner />

All OET staff share a responsibility for finding and flagging new opportunities for OET to have impact. Some members of staff have specific business development tasks, but all others are still expected to bring opportunities they come across within their own networks or during their day-to-day work to the table. We do this using the following steps:

## Step 1 - analyze
If you come across a potential opportunity for OET, feel free to spend up to 4 hours to analyze it further (e.g., reading tender documents, discussion with stakeholders, etc.). If you do not have the time to do this yourself, create a thread on Discord (in #funding), using the template provided there, so someone else can look into it. You can also use a Discord thread to ask for second opinions. Always check the eligibility criteria, not just the technical requirements!

## Step 2 - flag
Create a thread on Discord (in #funding), using the template provided there. Indicate if you’d like to take the lead in proposal writing, just want to be involved, or don’t want to be involved at all. 

## Step 3 - go/no-go 
Your Head of Department and/or the Head of Research and Market Development will give an initial go/no-go for development of a proposal. If you’ve indicated that you do not want to take the lead, they will appoint someone else to do this. In case of a go, an entry (‘Deal’) will need to be created on HubSpot, our CRM system. If you do not have access to HubSpot yourself, ask a Head of Department or someone in the Market Development team. Always record
- A name for the proposed project
- The projected start- and end dates of the project
- The probability of success (note: this is subjective; use your best estimate)
- The total value of the project, in euros
- The deadline for submission of the proposal/quote (if there is no deadline, set a realistic internal deadline)
- The client (if the organization does not yet exist in HubSpot, create it)
- Any individuals at the client organization or at collaborators

## Step 4 - proposal preparation and submission
Create the proposal, asking for help from whoever you need on Discord or, if elements of the proposal are confidential even within OET, directly. OET templates are available. Keep the information on HubSpot up to date (e.g., update it if the value or probability of success change), and ensure any key communication with the client/funder is logged on HubSpot, including the final submission. Keep your Head of Department informed about progress. Make sure your proposal is reviewed by someone who has not actively taken part in writing it; this can be your Head of Department, the Head of Research and Market Development, or another colleague. Note also the Handbook section on rates.
