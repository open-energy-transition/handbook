# Open energy transition password policy

## 1. A note about password security

Securely storing your OET-related passwords is essential to our maintaining organizational security. This policy serves not only as a Q&A about password management, but also to state the requirement to use 1Password to store all OET-related passwords, whether or not you will be sharing them with team mates.

If you are using another password manager, or storing your organizational passwords elsewhere, please move them over to 1Password once you are invited to the platform. If you have questions, you can reach out to our platform admin = our Head of People, Quintin.

### 1Password
OET uses a major, global, trusted password platform (1Password) to manage all its organizational passwords, and their sharing across teams in various vaults.

1Password is trusted by major organizations including GitLab, IBM, Slack, salesforce, and Canva. The company has over 150,000 clients, and is the most-used enterprise password manager.

- The platform integrates an admin dashboard, through which OET can manage secure password sharing vaults, for specific teams
- 1Password integrates many modern security standards, including FIDO2 and SSO
- The platform offers autofill via browser extensions, as well as offline access via its desktop app
- The app can be installed on OSes including Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS, as well as browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
- Through its Watchtower feature, organizational security risks can be mitigated
- Their Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol never transmits passwords to their servers
- Their vaults use end-to-end 256-bit encryption
- Every user account is secured via a 128-bit encrypted Secret Key
- The dashboard offers granular control over access and sharing, on a per-user level
- The app offers an easy-to-use password generator, so you can ensure you're using strong passwords

## 2. Process for storing and sharing OET passwords

1. Activate your account
   - Quintin will send you an invitation email
   - Click the link within 2 days, before it expires (otherwise it will need to be resent)
   - Choose a secure Master Password that you can remember
   - Store your account backup information securely (ideally not on a device on which you use the 1Password platform)

2. Set up 2FA
   - 2FA is mandatory, and you will receive a prompt to enable it
   - Please select a secure, trusted 2FA app, and follow the setup steps to enable it for your 1Password account
   - You may be asked during future logins for your 2FA code, so that the app can verify it is you who is logging in
   - Any any time, you can easily switch to a different 2FA app. Just remember to activate the new one before removing 1Password from the old one
   - If you wish, you may save a device as trusted in 1Password

3. Join your team sharing vaults (if applicable)
   - You may be added to one or more team vaults, for the purpose of easy access to shared passwords
   - If you receive an invitation to join a vault, please do so
   - If you want to store a password in 1Password that should be accessible to all members of your vault, please place it inside there
   - If you don't want others to access a password, please store it in your own personal vault, as this vault is only accessible by you

4. Install the apps
   - You can install any apps for 1Password that you like, depending on your browser/s and OS/es
   - You will need to use your full account details to log in for each new device you use. Please keep track of which devices you're logged in on
   - If there is a login from a brand new device, you will be emailed, after which you can make sure it was indeed you who actioned it

4. Store your passwords
   - You will be able to store passwords and payment information in 1Password
   - You can use the standard info fields, like username, password, and URL, as well as add other ones through dropdown menus
   - 1Password offers a built-in strong password generator tool for you to easily, automatically generate really good passwords, and put them right in the app
   - If you want to, you can edit stored information at a later stage. Just click, "Edit", and change or input whatever you wish, and then click, "Save"
   - Any changes to stored info may take a bit of time to update across all the platforms on which you use 1Password, but this process is fully automated
   - If you want to, you can also attach files to the passwords you house in 1Password, for additional secure storage

Thank you!
