# Spending company money

<ControlledDocBanner />

## Standard process

As you likely already know, OET has a very trusting culture, and that extends to entrusting all team members to spend company money wisely, and consider maintaining business continuity when doing so. This applies to absolutely any money spent.

Consider whether the money needs to be spent. Consider also whether there are better options available (these may be cheaper, or they may be more expensive, but do more, or scale better). Essentially, make sure you're making a sensible decision.

The contact people for specific payment-related matters are:

- Tooling (platforms): Head of People, Quintin Coetzee
- Travel per diems: Head of Finance, Andris Prindulis
- Project-related matters: Your Project Director and/or your manager

## Tooling

It is always a preference to set up billing for apps using our company card. Whenever possible, please do not set up recurring billing on your personal card and expense it. It is simpler for payroll, tax, etc. if OET is billed directly.

As such, if you can motivate why you need what you need access to, or your manager or HoD has already greenlit it, and you just need billing info plugged into the account, please contact Quintin, our Head of People, as he will be able to do so for you.

## Travel

Per diems for travel are set per country and per event. Please check what the applicable per diem is for your upcoming travel as far in advance as possible. You can ask the organizer of the trip, and/or our Finance Team.
Please also keep your receipts for everything that needs one during the expense claims process.
For more info, you can consult the Travel section of the Handbook.

## Other cases

If you're not sure about something related to this, which isn't covered by the above, please feel free to follow these steps:

- Check with your manager
- Check with your HoD
- Ask our Head of People (Quintin)
- Ask our Head of Finance (Andris)
