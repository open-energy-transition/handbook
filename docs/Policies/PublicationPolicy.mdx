# Publication Policy

OET is committed to producing high-quality, transparent, and impactful publications that advance open energy modeling research and practice. 
OET team members are actively encouraged to publish their work in a way that maximizes impact. Apart from project reports for clients, this can include white papers, conference papers, editorials, publications in sectoral magazines, newspapers, and any other outlet. 
We do not have a list of preferred outlets but encourage team members to make their own decisions on which outlets are best, in collaboration with their team leads, project leads, and Heads of Department. We do have a few ground rules:

1. **All OET publications, including final project reports, should be** **reviewed by at least one colleague who has not been involved in writing**. If the reviewer has any concerns, these should be addressed before publication, and the reviewer should be informed about how their comments are addressed. If the reviewer is not satisfied, the relevant Head of Department or the Head of Research and Market Development should be consulted. If you have trouble finding a reviewer, contact your Head of Department; they will assign someone.   
     
2. If you expect publications to garner significant media attention and/or to be controversial, they should also be reviewed by both your Head of Department and either the Head of Research and Market Development or the CEO. 

3. Publications must be factually accurate, evidence-based, and well-documented. Sources, data, and assumptions should be transparent and reproducible wherever possible.

4. Where possible, publications should be planned and coordinated with OET’s communications team. Notify the communications team when you plan to publish something, as far in advance as possible. Publications using an OET format should follow OET’s style guide, which the communications team can assist with. 

5. OET publications reflect independent analysis and are not influenced by funding sources or external pressures. If you feel that your publication is being influenced by external stakeholders, and need help to counteract this, contact the Head of Research and Market Development to discuss this.  
     
6. Authorship must be fairly assigned to contributors. External collaborators and partners must be acknowledged appropriately.

7. OET team members should not publish in [predatory journals](https://beallslist.net). When in doubt, consult the Head of Research and Market Development.

8. In line with our mission, publications should be open-access whenever possible. When putting together a project budget, particularly for research-intensive projects, include any costs for open-access publication. 

9. OET should be listed as an affiliation if any OET resources (time, contacts, data, models) were used for it. If you publish work that is based on research you performed at a previous institution, it is normally possible to add both the institution the work was performed at, and the current affiliation. Use the full name “Open Energy Transition” in your affiliation.  
     
10. Final versions of publications should be stored on the OET Shared Drive, under \\Publications. Start the file name with the publication data (yymmdd), followed by an appropriate title. Save two versions of the file: one .pfd, and one editable file (e.g., Google Doc or Microsoft Word document).
