# Conflict resolution policy

<ControlledDocBanner />

## Purpose

The purpose of this Conflict Resolution Policy is to provide guidelines for addressing and resolving conflicts that may arise within the OET workplace. This policy ensures that conflicts are managed constructively and professionally to maintain a positive and productive work environment.

## Scope

This policy applies to all OET employees, contractors, and stakeholders involved in OET activities.

## Principles

1. **Respect and Fairness**: All parties involved in a conflict will be treated with respect and fairness.
2. **Confidentiality**: Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the conflict resolution process.
3. **Impartiality**: Conflicts will be resolved impartially, without favoritism or bias.
4. **Promptness**: Conflicts will be addressed and resolved promptly to prevent escalation.

## Steps for Conflict Resolution

### 1. Self-Resolution

- **Direct Communication**: Employees are encouraged to address the conflict directly with the other party involved. This should be done calmly and respectfully, aiming for a mutually agreeable solution.
- **Seek Understanding**: Listen to each otherâ€™s perspectives and seek to understand the underlying issues.

### 2. Involvement of Team Leaders

If self-resolution is not successful or feasible:

- **Report the Conflict**: Bring the issue to the attention of your designated Team Leader (TL). If a TL has not been yet assigned to you, please bring up the issue to the Head of Operations and Strategy (HoOS).
- **Mediation**: The TL will mediate the discussion between the parties involved, facilitating a resolution.

### 3. Formal Resolution Process

If the conflict remains unresolved:

- **Written Complaint**: Submit a written complaint to your TL or the HoOS detailing the conflict, including relevant dates, parties involved, and any attempts at resolution.
- **Investigation**: They will conduct a thorough investigation, interviewing all parties involved and reviewing any relevant documentation.
- **Resolution Meeting**: They will convene a meeting with the parties involved to discuss findings and propose a resolution.
- **Follow-Up**: They will then monitor the situation to ensure the resolution is effective and that no further issues arise.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Employees

- Address conflicts promptly and professionally.
- Participate in conflict resolution processes in good faith.
- Respect confidentiality throughout the process.

### Supervisors and Managers

### HoOS and/or Human Resources (HR)

## Documentation and Record-Keeping
