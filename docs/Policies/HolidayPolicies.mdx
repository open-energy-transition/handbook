## 1. Festive season leave policy

### Overview:
- To promote rest and well-being, all OET staff are **encouraged** to take extended leave during the festive season between **23 December 2024 and 1 January 2025**.  
- This period is not compulsory, and staff may choose to work during these dates.  
- Due to high anticipated absence, tasks and deliverables for this time should be:  
  - **Agreed in detail and in advance** with Project Leads and/or direct reports.  
  - Documented clearly to ensure seamless workflows.

## 2. Carry-over leave policy

### What is it?
The **Carry-Over Leave Policy** allows staff to transfer unused leave days from the current calendar year into the next year, under specific conditions.  

### Key points:
- Staff are **strongly encouraged** to use their annual leave entitlement within the current year.  
- However, up to **1 day for each month** you have been with OET (maximum of 5 days) can be carried over.  
- Example:  
  - If you’ve been with OET for 6 months, you can carry over up to 5 days.  
  - If you’ve been with OET for 3 months, you can carry over 3 days.  

### Process for carrying over leave:
1. Send an **email to the Operations team** requesting the carry-over of leave days.  
2. The request should specify:  
   - Number of days to carry over.  
   - Confirmation that this leave has been discussed and agreed upon with your Project Lead.  
3. The Operations team will **manually track** transferred leave days.  
4. These days must be used **within the following year** and cannot be carried over multiple times.  

**Important note:**
Carry-over requests **cannot** be made through Remote.com, as the platform does not support leave transfers.

## 3. Bring-forward leave policy

### What is it?
The **Bring-Forward Leave Policy** allows staff to **borrow leave days** from the following calendar year to use in the current year.  

### Key points:
- Up to **1 day for each month** you have been with OET (maximum of 5 days) can be brought forward.  
- Example:  
  - If you’ve been with OET for 6 months, you can bring forward up to 5 days.  
  - If you’ve been with OET for 3 months, you can bring forward 3 days.  
- Borrowed days will be **deducted** from your total leave entitlement for the following year.

### Process for bringing forward leave:
1. Send an **email to the Operations team** requesting the bring-forward of leave days.  
2. The request should specify:  
   - Number of days to bring forward.  
   - Confirmation that this leave has been discussed and agreed upon with your Project Lead.

## 4. Flexible bank holidays policy

### What is it?

  - **Communicated and agreed** in advance with your Project Lead.  
  - Tasks and deliverables for the day are planned and confirmed ahead of time.  
- The bank holiday must be “exchanged” for another day off **within 3 months** following the bank holiday.  

### Process for flexible bank holidays:
