# About OET

Open Energy Transition (OET) is a nonprofit organization. We want to accelerate the global energy transition with open source and open data. Our tools are transparent, flexible and can be customized after your needs and we help with software, studies, and capacity building and training.


# The Elevator Pitch (short)
<i>Imagine now that you are taking the elevator with someone you don't know but who might just be a potential partner or customer. They ask: "So what does your company do", and you can answer in 30 seconds:</i>

We develop and adapt open-source modelling tools for practical energy system planning. By advancing open-source models and open data, we collaborate with philanthropic funders and industry partners to empower transmission system operators, energy regulators, and NGOs to work together toward a secure, transparent, and data-driven energy future. Our mission is to accelerate the energy transition and make open modelling a mainstream part of energy planning practice by 2030. This is not a distant vision — the ecosystem is ready, and impactful collaborations are already underway.
