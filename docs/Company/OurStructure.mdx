# Our Structure

The goal of our structure is to enable everyone to thrive in their respective roles. We want to enhance both our reporting and our communications channels, as we continue to grow as a team.

We have predefined roles for approvals, budgeting, project planning, hiring, and other decision making processes. This keeps things simple.

At OET, we maintain a relatively flat hierarchy, and, for the most part, you are free to manage a lot of your own workday, workflow, and priorities. Naturally, these things are still informed by your Team's needs, and the milestones of any projects you're working on. But, we maintain a high level of self-management, with Team Leads and Heads of Department there to guide and advise - as enablers.

We also have Lead Maintainers permanently taking care of various tools, as well as Project Leads, who step in to get projects across the finish line in the capacity of a temporary role, aside from their core functions at OET. In this way, everyone always knows who is likely to have answers to specific questions they might have, who is responsible for the things we're working on at any given time, and who to go to for particular resources. It is this streamlined and effective structure that allows us to thrive, independently and collaboratively, as a fully-remote, global team of experts in our respective fields.

# Departments at OET

OET is structured around six Departments:

* People & Culture
* Operations & Finance
* Software Engineering
* Research & Market Development
* Energy Tools & Data
* Energy System Modeling

These Departments each have their own areas of focus. However, they all often work together on goals that apply to the entirety of OET, as it should be.

Each Department has various Team Leads and Lead Maintainers reporting to the respective Head of Department. And, each Team Lead may have various OETers reporting into them. As a result, communication flows easily not only vertically, but also horizontally, across Teams and Departments. We can easily get things done on our own, and easily work together when a project requires that.

The company structure is available in the following [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TATFW1ixj26SEx0Jkun3K5UircP8Iygfxv3IwGO2C0c/edit?usp=sharing), which we shared with all OETers in March 2025, at the start of the rollout.

We're proud that we've been able to bring about additional structure, including formalized reporting, management, and communication channels, without reducing the strong level of autonomy, trust, and self-management that is inherent to our culture.
