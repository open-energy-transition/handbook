# Template documents

At OET, we use a consistent document style (especially for things that are sent externally). Therefore, we have templates you can use. These include templates for:

- Our letterhead (for general, official documents)
- Resumes
- Reports
- Presentations (slides)

You can find our templates in this shared folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1073XBypb_HDji3M3A6GEZJ5QaMsL5Mdh.

Please copy the relevant template to where you want to fill it in. Please do not edit the templates. If something is wrong (like a grammatical error) please notify an HOD, so it can be edited.

## What if I can't find a particular template?

Please check with an HOD. Likely either our Head of People, Quintin, or our Head of Business Strategy, Victor, will know. But, in their absence, another HOD may also know, or be able to help you find it, if it does exist.

## What if a template I need doesn't exist?

Then you're free to create one yourself, or request that it's made! (Whichever is easier). The steps are as follows:

- Check in with Quintin and/or Victor, to ask them about creating a new template, using our consistent style.
- They will let you know if you can make it yourself.
- Either way, the template is to be stored in the same parent folder that is linked above.
- Please create a subfolder if applicable.
- If you create your own template, please share it with Quintin and Victor before using it, so they can review it.
- If you think the new template would be useful to other OETers, then after it's reviewed, please feel free to share it with them directly, or via a Discord channel!
