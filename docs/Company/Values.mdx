# Values

Values (meaningful ones, at least), are a key part of strong, cohesive, and enjoyable cultures. It's important that we stick to our main values, and lead by example.

At OET, we have **6 main values** that guide everything we do.

Of course, as an NGO, and in accordance with our purpose, we are driven by a value of being consistently open-source. That is fundamental to our goals. But, we also have a few values relating to how we work together as a team. They form part of our internal culture.

With buy-in from our wonderful team of OETers, these values are incorporated into our long-term strategy, our day-to-day business decisions, the work that we do, and how we interact with one another as part of a team.

They really do serve as the foundation of why we are here and how we have an impact on society, as well as the goals and aspirations of those who contribute towards OET’s mission.

## Transparency

We strive to be as forthcoming with information as possible, with open, fluid communication channels, and clear feedback that travels in all directions. That is the only way we can ensure that we remain aligned, and that we all have the opportunity to learn and grow. Our team comprises many different skills, and sharing them is important. Through fostering a transparent culture, we build trust (another of our values).

## Collaboration

We are extremely autonomous and self-managed, however we do still collaborate extensively, across roles, Teams, Departments, and projects. That is intrinsic to the kind of work that we do. It is also how we ensure that our common goals are met, and ensure that knowledge sharing is consistent. A lot of our work is done asynchronously, but we also have a healthy amount of teamwork in support of our mission.

## Humility

We try our best to always remain modest. It is vital that none of us automatically assume we are the smartest person in the room. And, even if we know we are the best at something, to always remember that someone else might have a great idea we did not think of, and that their input is still valued. OET has no space for egos. We are all about open discussions, continuous growth, open-mindedness, mutual respect, and being humble about our achievements.

## Autonomy

We all have a very high level of autonomy at OET. That goes hand-in-hand with acknowledging that we hire skilled people, and then give them the freedom to do what they do best, ideally (insofar as is possible) in a way that they are comfortable with and can get behind. We all know how satisfying it is to be able to make and own decisions within your remit, and have managers there just to enable and guide. That is the standard approach we take within our structure at OET.

## Trust

We trust inherently. That means no one is expected to start from ground zero and earn all the trust they get. Rather, they get a high level of trust upfront, as soon as they start engaging with us (even before they have joined our team). This trust then translates into easily being able to give everyone the level of self-management we are so proud of.

## Recognition

We make a point of publicly and privately voicing our appreciation for each other’s contributions and successes - whether mutual or individual. Across our teams, our culture is about uplifting one another, celebrating our wins, and giving credit where it is due (even for traditionally “small things”). And, importantly, because we are all ultimately working towards the same mission, when we succeed individually, we succeed as a team.
